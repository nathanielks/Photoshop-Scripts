Months.jsx creates a new file that will then cycle through creating a layer for
each month of the year in the MONTH YEAR format. It then cycles through and finds
the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of the month prints it out in the MONTH DAY, YEAR format.
It's all customizable, so let me know if it doesn't make sense.

Header-Text-Replacement.jsx opens a file that you specify in the script, searches
for a specific layer, then replaces the content of that layer. It does exactly
what Months.jsx does, but opens a file, then exports each date for web (PNG24).
